TODO:
obs.: I can reuse the exact same AWS components as for titanic case

create RDS database
-- update pokemon.sql
-- then execute it in beaver

raw-to-structured:
- https://gist.github.com/33sticks/e033dee49a061101078c
-- parse url file and save all to csv
-- save csv to bucket

next steps: very similar to titanic case

Lambda of structured to SQS:

	- need to add AmazonEC2FullAccess permission to Lambda role so we can add it to RDS VPC

Lambda with SQS trigger:
